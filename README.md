Young (but experienced) software developer. 

Masters in Comp Sci. 

Loves Python and Kotlin but knows a bunch of different languages. 

Trying to get more time for Open Source development, however time is limited lately. 

Recently started whoring on a small testing framework in Python, called [Expecthon](https://github.com/svadilfare/expecthon), with the focus of tests being in natural language.
